V1
    Incorrect because once the user clicks, the didPressDown variable is permanently switched to true because there is nothing in our loop that will set didPressDown back to false.
    Possible Fixes:
        (1) In the portion of the code where the hover color is being changed based on whether isClicked is true, immediately after line 26 (in V1 code) set isClicked back to false.

V2
    Incorrect for multiple reasons. V2 has the same exact issue as is present in V1. In addition to this, V2 saves off on line 21 the value of isMousePressed() and stores the value in didPressDown. However, this is useless because the purpose of didPressDown is to store information about the PREVIOUS frame so that we can utilize it in the current frame. Since we are setting the value of didPressDown immediately when we begin a new run-through of our animation loop, the value of didPressDown is always going to store the value of isMousePressed() for the current frame.
    Possible Fixes:
        (1) Do fix (1) stated in the V1 possible fixes. Then move the line 21 to line 25 so that it comes after the if-statement. This works because the if-statement on line 23 is the only time in which we need to look back at the previous frame's value of isPressedDown()-- so once we have done this, it is safe to overwrite didPressDown so that we can utilize that value in the next run-through of our animation loop.

V3
    This one works!

V4
    This does not work due to the way the if-statement is structured on line 26.
    Possible Fixes:
        (1) Use an "else if" to on line 28 that checks for if
