Scenario:
-You have a single ArrayList with the variable name: squid
-squid contains exactly one of each integer between 0 and 200,000,000
-The ordering of the integers in squid is completely random

Task:
-Pick a random integer between 0 and 200 million. Determine what the index location is of your chosen random integer.

Question:
-What would be an efficient way to complete this task?
-Brainstorm and come up with an idea. Then I'll ask people to share.

Possible solutions:
-Run through and check one spot at a time.

Task #2:
-Do the previous task 100,000,000 of times with a new random integer each time.

Possible Solutions:
-Each time you find the number, remove it from the array. Continue finding integers by scanning through from the start.

Conclusion:
-Sort the elements in the list first so that they are in order. And THEN do the above task easily.
