            -When checking for collisions between asteroids and bullets, you'll need a for-loop nested in another for-loop.
            -Asteroids
                -Wrap-around logic for when asteroid reaches edge of screen
                -Asteroids get smaller the more you shoot them
                -Start off with 5 asteroids on screen (get stored in index 0-4)
                    -For ex, let's say you shoot the asteroid at index 2.
                        -Shrink the asteroid at index 2. Add another asteroid at index 5. Both asteroids are Medium size.
                        -You shoot the medium asteroid at index 2.
                            -Shrink the asteroid at index 2. Add another asteroid at index 6. Both asteroids are Small.
                                -You shoot the small asteroid at index 6.
                                -Whenever shoot a small asteroid, it disappears.
                                    -Ideas on how to indicate asteroid has disappeared: changing value to null (alternatively, you could flip a boolean flag to have it no longer be visible).
                                        -Let's say you shoot the Large asteroid at index 1.
                                            -This should give you two new asteroids that are medium in size. For the asteroid at index 1, just shrink it. For the other asteroid, add it at index 7.
