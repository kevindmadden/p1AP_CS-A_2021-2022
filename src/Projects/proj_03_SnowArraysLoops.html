    <h1>Project #03 - Snow, Arrays, and Loops</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Improve the quality of the snow animation we went over in class. If you wish, you can also make something of your own from scratch as long as it meets the below requirements.
        </p>
    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create at least two <strong>new</strong> arrays to use in making improvements to the snow animation.</li>
        <li>Use of for-loops to cycle through the elements in the new arrays you create.</li>
        <li>The improvement(s) you make must be meaningful.</li>
        <li>Examples of non-meaningful improvements:
            <ul>
                <li>You create a String array with a single element, perhaps to store the name of a color. You then use a for-loop that runs once to cycle through the one element in the array.</li>
                <li>You change the color of the snowflakes to black.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Examples of Meaningful Changes:
            <ul>
                <li>Create an array to store the y-velocity of each snowflake.</li>
                <li>Create an array to store the x-velocity of the each snowflake. (This could be used to make snowflakes sway back and forth as they fall.</li>
                <li>Create an array that sets the fall-angle of each snowflake.</li>
                <li>Create an array that changes the size of the snowflakes in some manner over time.</li>
                <li>Create arrays to store positions of clouds floating across the sky.</li>
                <li>Create an array to store wind related affects on snowflakes.</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ol>
