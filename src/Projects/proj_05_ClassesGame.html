<h1>Project #05 - Create Your Own Game - Classes</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Using StdDraw, create your own game (or other application). You can come up with your own original game or imitate something else. Aside from the Main class, you need to write at least two classes of your own. The classes you write need to be involved in the final product in a meaningful way. </p>
<p>When you decide on something you would like to do for your project, you need to run your idea by me. I want to make sure your project idea is complex enough but not so complex that you will not be able to realistically finish in time.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In addition to the Main method, you need to write two of your own classes for the assignment.</li>
    <li>The two classes you write must play a meaningful role in your program.</li>
    <li>There needs to be a graphical component to your project. You must use StdDraw for the graphical component.</li>
    <li>We have discussed MVC (model, view, controller) in class on multiple occasions. You should be following this paradigm in your code. There should be a clear division in your code between the model (calculations, properties, etc.), the view (drawing based on the model), and the controller (updating the model based on user input).</li>
    <li>Your project needs to be sufficiently complex.</li>
    <li>In order to eliminate the potentially large amount of subjectivity in deciding whether you have created something sufficiently complex, you must get your project idea approved by me before you start. Please get my attention during class to give me a rough overview of what you would like to make.</li>
    <li>Once I approve your idea, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQreFRNsvjxUzEO0IEyiCqYi6dBpR3z1KW2vbn2XrPl4Vndg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this survey</a> with your more detailed plan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading:</h2>
Given the wide variety of projects people will be submitting, what I'm looking for in terms of grading will vary depending on your approach/project. Here is the general gist of how I will be grading:
<ul>
    <li>0: Your code is indicative of a lack of effort. Your code may error out immediately or while running. You either did not get approval from me for your project idea, or you accomplished little to nothing of what I approved for you to do for your project.</li>
    <li>2: You partially accomplished what you planned on creating, but you fell short of fully implementing the project you got approved to complete. You may land here if there are routine bug(s) that distract or prevent the user from playing your game. Note that if there are bugs that crash your game and throw error messages, then you would fall in the 0 rather than the 2 category.
    <li>3: You implemented your approved project idea. Your program is functional, but it is missing a wow-factor.</li>
    <li>4: You fully implemented your project idea. Your program is not merely functional but is truly novel/creative in some manner. </li>
</ul>
