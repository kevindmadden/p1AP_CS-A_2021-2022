    <h1>Project #02 - Putting It All Together</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Create an animation that responds in some way both to mouse clicks and mouse hovering.
        </p>
    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Your animation must react in two different ways. In other words, your animation should not respond in the exact same way to both mouse clicking versus hovering. </li>
        <li>A reaction can be pretty much anything that is visible on the screen. It can be as simple as changing a color.</li>
        <li>Experiment around with what you can do with the toolset you have been given so far. Take your time to figure out how everything works together.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Reminder:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You will need to use if-statements in the animation loop so that certain parts of your code gets run only when certain conditions are met.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Animate a rectangle bounding back and forth on the screen. (Use an if-statement to reverse the velocity if the rectangle's coordinates reach the edge of the screen.)</li>
        <li>Animate the rectangle growing in size when you click on it. Have the rectangle shrink when </li>
    </ol>
